# OC-P6

My 6th project for OpenClassrooms Python path. It consists designing technicals specs of a pizza group. 

* A __class diagram__ modeling the structure of the system, and the relationship between classes, their attributes and methods.

* The __ER diagram__ describes the relational database that will be implemented with all liaison tables and cardinalities.

* __Components diagram__ shows the relationship between the components of the system, and all provided and required interfaces for each component.

* The __deployement diagram__ models the physical deployement of the system, with all hardware and software needed, such as Gunicorn, load balancer, NGIX, database server, ...

Finally, __create_db.sql__ contains an sql script for creating the relational database and all fake data needed.
__sql_request.sql__ contains dozen of sql requests that can be used to challenge the way the database is implemented.
